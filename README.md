# Messenger
Just a messenger

Basically you have to install messenger.py on 2 computers(which are connected either by lan or wlan or whwatever)
Then, connect using ip addresses.

How to use: 

Now I know what you are thinking: How do I get my Ip to the other computer? 
Do I send it using another messenger? Well... it depends.
If the other person is in yelling distance, Ip can be sent manually.
Or if they are not in yelling distance, then pigeons.
